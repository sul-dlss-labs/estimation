## Results

The template will likely evolve over time, but its initial drafting took under a day (about an hour for Mike Giarlo to draft it initially, a 30ish minute meeting to intro the idea and refine it among six of the infra devs, a couple small touchup PRs, about 35 minutes to draft this PR).

The template is here: https://github.com/sul-dlss-labs/estimation/blob/master/template.md

Scope has expanded slightly, with the addition of this section. We hope it will provide a helpful way to spot trends in our analyses.
