# Work Estimation Record Template

## Description

### Replace OpenWayback with PyWB for SWAP

* Requested By: Vivian Wong
* Estimate requested: June 22, 2020
* Reason: To determine whether to replace OpenWayback with PyWB.

[Stanford Web Archive Portal](https://swap.stanford.edu/) (SWAP) is currently a [forked](https://github.com/sul-dlss/openwayback) instance of [OpenWayback](http://netpreserve.org/web-archiving/openwayback/). OpenWayback is a "wayback machine," a service that provides access to archived websites.

The issues with SWAP include:

* OpenWayback is highly legacy software that is not actively supported and released. As Kristinn SigurÃ°sson, Head of IT at the National and University Library of Iceland and the Lead of the IIPC Tools Development Portfolio, recently [notes](https://netpreserveblog.wordpress.com/tag/pywb/):

> Unfortunately, it has been clear for some time that OpenWayback would require a ground up rewrite if it were to be continued on. The software, now almost a decade and a half old, is complicated and archaic. Adding features is nearly impossible and often bug fixes require exceptional effort. This has led to OpenWayback falling behind as web material evolves. Its replay fidelity fading.

* The version of OpenWayback that we are running is extremely old.
* The instance of OpenWayback that we are running has been customized; those customizations are [partially understood and documented](https://github.com/sul-dlss/swap).
* There is a [production bug](https://github.com/sul-dlss/was_robot_suite/issues/235) with handling HTTPS sites. Attempts to address resolve this have been unsuccessful.

The current state-of-the-art wayback machine is [PyWB](https://github.com/webrecorder/pywb). In fact, the IIPC is funding enhancement of PyWB and [the British Library replaced OpenWayback with PyWB](https://blogs.bl.uk/webarchive/2018/02/a-new-playback-tool-for-the-uk-web-archive.html), as have other institutions. Justin Littman has previous experience with PyWB and found it to be very robust, well documented software.

## Scope Assumptions / Constraints

The scope of the work is deploying a new instance of SWAP running PyWB and decommissioning the existing instance.

The assumption is that we will attempt to replicate the existing look-and-feel as closely as reasonable; reconsidering the look-and-feel / user experience is likely to add significant additional work.

### Major tasks

* Provision new qa/stage/prod servers and install PyWB.
  * Docker is recommended for deploy, but Apache is documented.
  * Will require temporarily duplicating WARC files (32 TB).
  * Monitoring (Nagios and Honeybadger)
* Customize UI templates to match current look-and-feel.
* Re-index all existing WARC files.
* Change the `wasCrawlDisseminationWF`.
  * The existing indexing steps can be collapsed from 3 to 1; indexing in PyWB is much simpler than the existing process.
* Testing, including with the old SLAC website.
* Decommission the existing servers.
* Update/write documentation including DevOpsDocs.

## Risks / Challenges / External Dependencies

* PyWB is a Python application; we don't have much experience deploying Python applications. (Note that Justin Littman and Jeremy Nelson have significant Python experience.)
  * Deploying a Python application consistent with our other deployments (e.g., shared configurations) may require novel work.
* Highly dependent upon Ops resource availability.
* Existing SWAP is not well understood, so testing may be murky.
* It is likely that default indexing can be used; however, in the event that our indexes exceed the capabilities of the default indexing additional work will be required to implement one of the alternative indexing strategies.
* Unexpected "gotchas". While web archive playback is well understood, our own unique requirements are not.

## Open Questions

* Can the existing look-and-feel be fully reproduced with PyWB UI templates?
* Can the default indexing be used?
* Can existing seed URLs be maintained? (That is, the SWAP URLs stored in the metadata of web archiving seed items.)

## Estimation Contributors

Estimates are of higher quality when multiple parties participate. List here the people who contributed to the estimation:

* Justin Littman
* Mike Giarlo
* Aaron Collier
* Justin Coyne
* Jeremy Nelson

The team that would likely do the work should ideally be the same people providing the estimate, but we acknowledge that this is not always the case so it is not assumed here that the contributors above are the people who would be doing the work being estimated.

## Time Spent Producing Estimate

This research and this estimate took approximately 2 hours.

## Confidence Level

75%, due to the risks articulated above.

## Estimate Range

* Between 1 month and 2 months for a single developer at 50% of his/her time.
* Undetermined Ops engineer time.
