# Records

- [WER-0000](0000-work-estimation-record.md) - Lightweight work estimation record.

# Process

Requests for work estimation should be written up as new pull requests, based on the [estimation template](template.md). Please follow these two practices in your pull requests:

1. Name new WER files with the `nnnn-brief-summary-of-work.md` format; and
2. Add a link to the new WER to `README.md`

Once your pull request has been reviewed, approved, and merged into the `master` branch, GitHub will automatically trigger a Jekyll build and redeploy the site. You should see your changes within 1-2 minutes of the merge.
