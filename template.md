# Work Estimation Record Template

## Description

* **WHAT**: a brief narrative describing the work for which an estimation was requested
* **WHO**: the requester's name
* **WHEN**: the date the estimation was requested
* **WHY**: the rationale for how the estimate will be used/valued

## Scope Assumptions / Constraints

Document scoping assumptions made and constraints given while producing the estimate. Surface these explicitly to ensure all parties have a shared understanding or what is included within, or without, the scope of the work.

## Risks / Threats

Write up potential risks or threats that could significantly affect the produced estimate.

## Open Questions

A list of questions that were not answered, or answerable, by the team producing the estimate. Answers to these questions could significantly alter the estimate.

## Contributors (Team)

The team that would likely do the work should ideally be the same people providing the estimate. Estimates are of higher quality when multiple engineers participate:

* A
* List
* Of
* Contributors

## Time Spent

Characterize the time spent producing the estimate. This is factored into the confidence level.

## Confidence Level

Express as a percentage, or range of percentages, the estimating team's overall confidence in the estimate.

## Estimate Range

This is the amount of time estimated for the above team to tackle the work as described. The estimate should be expressed as a range between two orders of magnitude, chosen from the below values:

* An hour
* A day
* A week
* A month
* Three months
* Six months
* Nine months
* A year
* More than a year
