# Work Estimation Record Template

## Description

* **WHAT**: a brief narrative describing the work for which an estimation was requested
* **WHO**: the requester's name
* **WHEN**: the date the estimation was requested
* **WHY**: the rationale for how the estimate will be used/valued

## Scope Assumptions / Constraints

Document scoping assumptions made and constraints given while producing the estimate. Surface these explicitly to ensure all parties have a shared understanding or what is included within, or without, the scope of the work.

## Risks / Challenges / External Dependencies

Write up potential risks, challenges, or external dependencies that could significantly affect the produced estimate.

Examples of external dependencies could include:

* Stakeholders outside of your team, within DLSS, SUL, or Stanford University;
* Operations needs
* Open-source community review, approval, or interactions

## Open Questions

A list of questions that were not answered, or answerable, by the team producing the estimate. Answers to these questions could significantly alter the estimate.

## Contributors (Team)

Estimates are of higher quality when multiple parties participate. List here the people who contributed to the estimation:

* A
* List
* Of
* Contributors

The team that would likely do the work should ideally be the same people providing the estimate, but we acknowledge that this is not always the case so it is not assumed here that the contributors above are the people who would be doing the work being estimated.

## Time Spent

Characterize the time spent producing the estimate. This is factored into the confidence level.

## Confidence Level

Express as a percentage, or range of percentages, the estimating team's overall confidence in the estimate.

## Estimate Range

This is the amount of time estimated for the above team to tackle the work as described. The estimate should be expressed as a range between two orders of magnitude, chosen from the below values, for a given number of team members at a given allocation (with the understanding that 100% of a DLSS engineer's time is roughly 75% of their "contact time," due to competing priorities and time spent in meetings):

* An hour
* A day
* A week
* A month
* Three months
* Six months
* Nine months
* A year
* More than a year

Example: Between three months and nine months for a team of four engineers working at 75% contact time.
